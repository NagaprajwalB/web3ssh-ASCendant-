<h2> Problem
<h4> Traditional smart contracts are great for automation but fail when human judgment is needed like assessing the quality of freelance work or resolving subjective disputes. 
<h2> Solution
<h4> We introduce an AI-Powered system built on BlockChain that integrates Vertex-AI with Chainlink oracles to evaluate dispute evidence and deliver fair, automated verdicts directly to a Solidity-based escrow contract.

This system bridges the gap between decentralized logic and human-like reasoning bringing trust, automation, and scalability to dispute resolution in Web3.
